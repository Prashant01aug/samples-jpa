jpql-function
=============

Sample showing how to add support for a Java Function to JPQL for RDBMS.

Look at

* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/samples-jpa/blob/master/jpql_method/src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF">src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</a>  The MAINFEST.MF file for the plugin jar, defining the plugin imports/exports.
* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/samples-jpa/sample-jpql-method/blob/master/src/main/resources/plugin.xml">src/main/resources/plugin.xml</a>   The plugin.xml file for the plugin jar, defining what features are being provided by this plugin.

Provides a very simple test of the use of this JPQL function.
